## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find rig_ui.py script"

The addon searches for scripts with "rig_ui" in the name from the same library as the armature. Ensure your character file has a properly named rig UI script.

### "Library file not found"

Use the **Reference Manager → Relocate File** button to point to the new location of your library file.

### "Override properties not editable"

Click **"Make All Editable"** in the Quick Actions panel, or enable **"Auto Make Editable"** in Link Settings before linking.

### Health check shows many issues

Run **"Repair Override"** to automatically fix common issues like missing editable properties and fully-locked bones.
